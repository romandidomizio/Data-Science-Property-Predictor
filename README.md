# CSCI-3002: Data-Science-Semester-Project

# Cook County Housing Data Analysis

This project is part of a class assignment where I explore housing data from Cook County and build a machine learning model to predict housing prices.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Part 1: Data Exploration**  
   In this part, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the housing dataset, identifying key features, understanding data trends, and performing the necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps.

2. **Part 2: Predicting Housing Prices**  
   In the second part, I utilized Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to build and evaluate multiple regression models for predicting housing prices. Additionally, I addressed potential biases and ensured fair outcomes in the predictive analysis, using Matplotlib and Plotly for visualization and interpretation.

## What I Learned

- **Data Exploration**: Handling and preprocessing real-world datasets, and deriving useful insights through exploratory analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Building and evaluating regression models, tuning hyperparameters, and interpreting model results.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Understanding and addressing potential biases to ensure fair predictions in machine learning models.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
